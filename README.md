# repopull
Service that listens on a socket and updates a specified repo. Written for a school project.

### Description
This program will listen on port 8080 for incoming GET requests. The `repoUpdate()`
function will attempt to update repos in the `/var/www/html` directory.

This program was written quickly to fit a specific use case for a school project.
(and was a great excuse to write some golang) Feel free to fork or file an issue.
